## 🚀 Running Solutions

Each day's solution is contained in its own directory. To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cd 01  # or any day number
go run main.go
```

## 📝 Solutions

### Day 1: Dial Puzzle
- **Part 1**: Count how many times the dial passes through position 0
- **Part 2**: Count full rotations (100 positions) including crossings

**Key Concepts**: Modular arithmetic, positive modulo implementation

### Day 2: Invalid ID Detection
- **Part 1**: Find palindromic IDs (first half mirrors second half)
- **Part 2**: Find IDs that are repeated patterns (e.g., 1234**1234**, 12**12**12)

**Key Concepts**: String pattern matching, palindrome detection, repeated pattern recognition

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
